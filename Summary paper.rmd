Project 2
In the realm of modern finance, the timely repayment of loans is of paramount importance for both lenders and borrowers. The core focus of our project revolves around the predictive analysis of loan approval based on an applicant's repayment history. By leveraging cutting edge data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to create a robust model that can assess an applicant's likelihood of paying their loans on time. This model will enable lending institutions to make more informed decisions regarding loan approvals, thereby reducing risks and enhancing the overall lending experience.
