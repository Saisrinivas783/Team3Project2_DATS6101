Project 2
In the realm of modern finance, the timely repayment of loans is of paramount importance for both lenders and borrowers. The core focus of our project revolves around the predictive analysis of loan approval based on an applicant's repayment history. By leveraging cutting edge data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to create a robust model that can assess an applicant's likelihood of paying their loans on time. This model will enable lending institutions to make more informed decisions regarding loan approvals, thereby reducing risks and enhancing the overall lending experience.
Our dataset contains 307,511 observations, which means that we have data on over 300,000 loan applicants. Each applicant is represented by 122 different pieces of information, such as their gender, income, education status, and employment status.



FOR PRESENTATION - need to focus on why this model and what we learned from this model, only 1 or 2 slides for EDA

Make sure you do adequate EDA to have a good understanding of all the variables since this is a new data set for your group. But focus you presentation and paper on the development, interpretation and assessment of the model. I see that you are interested in both inference (e.g. SMART question 1) and prediction (e.g. SMART question 5-6). This is great! Because both offer different but important information for lenders.

Which applicant characteristics and financial indicators exert the most significant influence on predicting loan approval decisions?
Are there any patterns in the repayment history of borrowers who default on their loans?
Can you identify any groups of borrowers who are at a higher risk of default?
How does the default rate vary by borrower employment status?
Can we develop predictive models to anticipate loan approval outcomes based on historical data and relevant applicant information?
What is the accuracy and reliability of these predictive models, and can they be effectively employed for future loan approval decisions and resource allocation within lending institutions?
