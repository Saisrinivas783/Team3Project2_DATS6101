Project 2
In the realm of modern finance, the timely repayment of loans is of paramount importance for both lenders and borrowers. The core focus of our project revolves around the predictive analysis of loan approval based on an applicant's repayment history. By leveraging cutting edge data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to create a robust model that can assess an applicant's likelihood of paying their loans on time. This model will enable lending institutions to make more informed decisions regarding loan approvals, thereby reducing risks and enhancing the overall lending experience.
Our dataset contains 307,511 observations, which means that we have data on over 300,000 loan applicants. Each applicant is represented by 122 different pieces of information, such as their gender, income, education status, and employment status.



FOR PRESENTATION - need to focus on why this model and what we learned from this model, only 1 or 2 slides for EDA
