Project 2
In the realm of modern finance, the timely repayment of loans is of paramount importance for both lenders and borrowers. The core focus of our project revolves around the predictive analysis of loan approval based on an applicant's repayment history. By leveraging cutting edge data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to create a robust model that can assess an applicant's likelihood of paying their loans on time. This model will enable lending institutions to make more informed decisions regarding loan approvals, thereby reducing risks and enhancing the overall lending experience.
Our dataset contains 307,511 observations, which means that we have data on over 300,000 loan applicants. Each applicant is represented by 122 different pieces of information, such as their gender, income, education status, and employment status.



FOR PRESENTATION - need to focus on why this model and what we learned from this model, only 1 or 2 slides for EDA


EDA

1. imputation > adding data for missing values
2. we will use Label Encoding for any categorical variables with only 2 categories and OneHot Encoding for any categorical 
variables with more than 2 categories.
3. ALigning and testing the data to match the values in train and test after encoding
4. Anomalies and outlier detection  mistyped numbers, errors in measuring equipment, or they could be valid but extreme measurements.
5. histogram 
6. correlation  Pearson correlation coefficient between every variable and the target 
7. barplot
8. kdeplot
9. heatmap of corrleation
10. As a final exploratory plot, we can make a pairs plot of the EXT_SOURCE variables and the DAYS_BIRTH variable.
The Pairs Plot is a great exploration tool because it lets us see relationships between multiple pairs of variables 
as well as distributions of single variables.Graphs in the pair plot > scatter plot, histogram , desnity plot
